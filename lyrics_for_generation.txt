I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world


Look at the stars,
Look how they shine for you,
And everything you do,
Yeah they were all yellow,

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know for you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

It's true look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for...
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
But I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight, Ooh

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright

As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall

Is a waterfall, ah
Is a waterfall, ah
Is a waterfall
Every tear is a waterfall, ah

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag, Wooh

It was a wa-ah-ah-ah-aterfall
A wa-ah-ah-ah-aterfall

Oh, Oh

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Oh, Oh

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home,
And ignite your bones,
And I will try to fix you,

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead (singing)
Come out of things unsaid, shoot an apple off my head (and a)
Trouble that can't be named, a tiger's waiting to be tamed (singing)
You are, you are

Confusion never stops, closing walls and ticking clocks (gonna)
Come back and take you home, I could not stop that you now know (singing)
Come out upon my seas, curse missed opportunities (am I)
A part of the cure, or am I part of the disease (singing)

You are [4x] (singing)
You are [2x]
And nothing else compares
Oh no nothing else compares
Oh and nothing else compares

You are [continues in background]
Home, home, where I wanted to go [2x](I went)
Home, home, where I wanted to go (I went)
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Come up to meet you,
Tell you I'm sorry,
You don't know how lovely you are.

I had to find you,
Tell you I need you,
Tell you I set you apart.

Tell me your secrets,
And ask me your questions,
Oh let's go back to the start.

Runnin' in circles,
Comin' up tails,
Heads on a science apart.

Nobody said it was easy,
It's such a shame for us to part.
Nobody said it was easy,
No one ever said it would be this hard.
Oh take me back to the start.

I was just guessin',
At numbers and figures,
Pullin' the puzzles apart.

Questions of science,
Science and progress,
Do not speak as loud as my heart.

Tell me you love me,
Come back and haunt me,
Oh, what a rush to the start.

Runnin' in circles,
Chasin' our tails,
Comin' back as we are.

Nobody said it was easy,
Oh it's such a shame for us to part.
Nobody said it was easy,
No one ever said it would be so hard.
I'm goin' back to the start.

Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh,
Ah ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh,
Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh,
Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ohh.
Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm going to give you my heart
Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
And cause you light up the path

I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky
Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms
Cause you get lighter
The more it gets dark
I'm going to give you my heart

And I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky
Cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

Because you're a sky
You're a sky full of stars

Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
Christmas night
Another fight
Tears we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood

Took my feet
To Oxford street
Trying to right a wrong
"Just walk away", those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh they flicker and they flow
And I'm up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope

Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Singing how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh Christmas lights
Keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh Christmas lights
Keep shining on

Oh woah oh oh oh oh oho

Oh Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights
Keep shining on
[Verse 1]
What in the world are we going to do?
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind of world do you want it to be?
Am I the future or the history?

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone hurts
Everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls
Everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out

[Verse 2]
How in the world I am going to see?
You as my brother
...Not my enemy?

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone hurts
Everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves
Everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life

[Outro]
At first light
Throw my arms out open wide
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Yes
There's a wild wind blowin'
Down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowin'
There's a cold war comin'
On the radio I heard
Oh baby, it's a violent world!

Oh love, don't let me go!
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear rain coming
I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground!

Time came a-creepin'
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light~
It goes oooooooonnnn
Time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night!

Oh love, don't let me go!
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear rain coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground!

(Oh oh oh!
Oh oh oh!
Ohh oh! )

Gravity release me,
And never hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground!
The birds they sang
The break of day
Start again I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away

The birds they sang
All a choir
Start again a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

The sky is blue
Dreamed of light til it's true
Then take it back the pause shall through
My arms turn wings
All those clumsy things
Send me up to the wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds

Might have to go
Where they don't know my name
Float all over the world
Just to see you again
But I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armour
Might rust in the rain

A simple plot
But I know one day
Good things are coming our way (Repeat twice)

Oh yeah
Call it magic
Call it true
I call it magic, when I'm with you
And I just got broken
Broken into two
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you

And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
Want anybody else but you

Ooh

Call it magic
Cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic
You're such a precious jewel


And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
Want anybody else but you

I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
Want anybody else but you

I want to fall, fall so far
I want to fall, fall so hard

I call it magic
And I call it true
Call it magic

Ooh

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Well yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Of course I do
So you lost your trust,
And you never should have,
And you never should have,
But don't break your back,
If you ever see this,
Don't answer that.

In a bullet proof vest,
With the windows all closed,
I'll be doing my best,
I'll see you soon,

In a telescope lens,
And when all you want is friends,
I'll see you soon.

So they came for you,
They came snapping at your heels,
They come snapping at you heels,
But don't break your back,
If you ever say this,
But don't answer that.

In a bullet proof vest,
With the windows all closed,
I'll be doing my best,
I'll see you soon,

In a telescope lens,
And when all you want is friends,
I'll see you soon,
I'll see you soon.

I know you lost your trust,
I know you lost your trust,
I know, don't lose your trust,
(feat. The Chainsmokers)

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Arigatou!!!
Arigatou gozaimasu!!!
For a second, I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise

And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

Tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me

Remember once upon a time, when I was
Yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

So tell me you love me
And if you don't then lie, lie to me
Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie, lie to me
If you don't then lie, lie to me

And call it true call it true love
Call it true call it true love
Twisted silent
Please decipher
We can still try
We're too young to die

So much for the fail safe
Wrong way down the runway
This scene's playing over
I can't think when I'm sober
I hear what you don't say
My heart beats like a freight train
This place doesn't feel the same
Is this the part where I walk away?

Twisted silent
Please decipher
We can still try
Too young to die

Shoelaces tied
Taxis outside
We can still try
We're too young to die

A long walk down the old street
They're sippin' sundowners on concrete
But me, I need something stronger
I guess I thought that I'd be stronger
Wet hair on a cold day
The kind of day you play Coldplay
I don't even like Coldplay
But today I need Coldplay

Twisted silent
Please decipher
We can still try
Too young to die

Shoelaces tied
Taxis outside
We can still try
We're too young to die

I left you in tears at the airport
Crying inside but I ain't make a sound
It's ironic, not even TSA could save us now
She's breaking down
We're breaking up, my Lady Luck, my favorite love
I think because I can't give up, the way it was
It really hurts us more than things that we don't say
I see your face in yellow every time I hear Coldplay
And you place on the pillowcase where you don't lay
In a bouquet of roses I left in your suitcase
Before I screwed it up and made you screw face
I think about you every time I hear a sad song
On New York Radio in Yellow Tax Cab songs
My mama told me many glass homes should be past stones
I left you by your own, now I'm grown and I don't wanna die alone
The twisted silence, relationships and violence
Shit was childish, I lost my queen, pop and ace of spades, king of diamonds
Just be honest, you was always fixing me
Now I don't know what else to do, but listen to "Fix You" on repeat
I hate Coldplay

Hardest part of moving on
Is really letting go (taxis outside)
I know you gotta find someone but I don't wanna know
The hardest part of moving on
Is really letting go (taxis outside)
I know you gotta find someone but I don't wanna know
No, no, no
And, if I lost a man
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Would you go

When you're tired of waiting
And you just find you never had a start
Come on baby, don't let it break your heart

Though, (everly we play?) still over call
Try and catcha cannonball

And it's slow and I'm tired oh, two majors flowing from a shipwreck, I
Heard the call

Well she said when you're tired of aiming your arrows, still you never hit
The mark
Oh, even when you're ready, there's shadows, still we never gonna part

Ah come on baby, don't let it break your heart
Oh, don't let it break your heart
Oh, don't let it break your heart
Been standing in the corner 
Studying the lights
The dreaming of escape 
Will keep you up at night

But someone had put the flares up
Got me in the rays so guess I better stay
"Uh uh, no come on!" You say

"It's a fools gold thunder
It's just warring rain
Don't let the fears just start
'What if I won't see you again'

Around here you never 
Want to sleep all night
So start falling in love, start the riot
And come on, rage with me

We don't need words, we'll be birds
Got to make our own key"

Only got this moment, you and me
Guilty of nothing but geography

Come on raise it
Come on and raise this noise
For the million people, who got not one voice

Come on it's not over!
If you mean it say loud
Come on all for love
Out from the underground away with me

We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
We'll be birds flying free
Holding on in the mystery

Fearless through this you said 
We'll go through this together
So when you fly won't you - won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel I think you're so cool

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died at every duel
This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still the sign upon my headstone, write
"A champion of the world"

[Interlude]
Oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best at taking flight
But my rocketship reversed
Oh, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
But I'll stand before conquistadors
'til I'm champion of the world

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Chris and Will]
(When I sail) And when I sail
I'm sailing west
(Though I might fail) Knowing I might fail
But, still I'm hoping for the best
(In my dreams) And in my dreams
Onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say
"I wandered the whole wide world but
Baby, you're the best"

[Interlude: Chris Martin]
Lo lo-lo-lo lo oh
Ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yeah
Lo lo-lo-lo lo

[Outro: Chris Martin and Will Champion]
So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I am jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe
I have E. T. On my bicycle
Because giving up won't work
I am riding on my rocketship
And I'm champion of the world
All winter
We got carried
Oh
Way over on the rooftops
Let's get married
All summer we just hurried
So come over
Just be patient
And don't worry
So come over
Just be patient
And don't worry

So come over
Just be patient
And don't worry
And don't worry

No I don't wanna battle
From beginning to end
I don't wanna cycle
Recycle revenge
I don't wanna follow
Death and all his friends

No I don't wanna battle
From beginning to end
I don't wanna cycle
Recycle revenge
I don't wanna follow
Death and all of his friends
Oh, they say people come
They say people go
This particular diamond was extra special

And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran, goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled in perfect purple

So how come things move on?
How come cars don't slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow

Like the brothers in blood, sisters who ride
Yeah we swore on that night we'd be friends till we died
But the changing of winds and the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling snow
Now I'm going to miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
I know that you're with me, and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow

Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
Stars in heaven align
Ohhhhhhhh I

Son, don't ask
Neither half full or empty is the glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast
Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

That green eyes, yeah the spotlight, shines upon you
And how could, anybody, deny you

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter, now I've met you
And honey you should know, that I could never go on without you

Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

That green eyes, you're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who, tried to deny you must be out of their mind

Cause I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter, since I met you
Honey you should know, that I could never go on without you

Green eyes
Green eyes

Ohohohohooooo
Ohohohohooooo

Ohohohohooooo
Ohohohohooooo

Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
They put the world in a tin can
Black market, contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh you wanna get it right sometimes

There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
Ah, if your hear can you let me know
How can they invade it
When it's so complicated?
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you learned
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna give up

And there's something missing
Seems like there's nobody listening
If you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man trapped
We don't wanna be shrink wrapped
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh we just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
But you can't believe a word
That's how you see the world
Ah, don't you worry yourself
Cause nobody can hurt you...
Oooooh..

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up

Life is a drink and loves a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

And said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony, now I just can't get enough

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony when I'm low, low, low, low

I, oh I, oh I, got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh I, oh I, I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's 
About to make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony, when I'm low, low, low, low

I, oh I, oh I, got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh I, oh I, oh I, I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

So high, so high

I, oh I, oh I, I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the

Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the
So I was an idiot
I was a goddamn idiot
Because I came here so violent
Because I came around here so violent

I said yes I was an idiot
I was a goddamn idiot
Because I made you think for it
Because I came round here to think for it

And sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot

Like an idiot...
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot

I was an idiot
I fell down like a goddamn idiot
Because I came here to bring them down
Because I came round here to fight them down
I said yes I felt like an idiot
I was a goddamn idiot

Sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot

Like an idiot...
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot

Listen now, it's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life

Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive...
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah

I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it...

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I'll wait for it

If you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?

Singing please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, me

Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out...  To me, me
Come back and sing it

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
And I was lost, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm in a cross

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve
No better and no worse

I just got lost
Every river that I've tried to cross
And every door I ever tried was locked
Ooh-Oh, And I'm just waiting till the shine wears off...

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost
Every river that you try to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Ooh-Oh, And I'm just waiting till the firing stops
Ooh-Oh, And I'm just waiting till the shine wears off
Ooh-Oh, And I'm just waiting till the shine wears off
Ooh-Oh, And I'm just waiting till the shine wears off...
Somewhere up above the stars
The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown,
A government is overthrown,
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last
And I heard it on the radio
That one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a tv show
That somewhere up above
And in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart,
Maybe moving us to mars
Past the satellites and stars,
Maybe moving us to mars
We won't see the earth again
In these seconds just remain unchanged
8 to 9, 9 to 10
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again you and me
We are meeting for the first time
Can't you see
76543
We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony
They'll be tearing us apart moving us to mars,
Past the satellites and stars
They're moving us to mars
You got wonder on what you knew
And wonder on what you do
So be careful who you're talking to

You got one eye on what you knew
And one eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do

So be careful... ! 
So be careful when you're walking in the view! 

Ooh-oooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you! 

Ooh-oooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you

You got one eye on what you knew
And one eye on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing is true

... Don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just gotta turn to... 

I hear those crocodiles ticking 'round the world
I hear those crocodiles ticking (you go) ticking 'round the world

Ooh-oooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you! 

Ooh-oooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and... 

Ooh-oooh-oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you! 
Got one eye on the road and one on you

Rosaleem of the Damascene

Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon
She went, "Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"

Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune
He went, "Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
(Boom boom ka, buba de ka, Boom boom ka, buba de ka, Boom boom ka, buba de ka)
Tulips the colour of honey today

But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I say, oh

La, la, la, la, oh…
La, la, la, la, oh…
La, la, la, la, oh…
La, la, la, la, oh…
How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where To, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know.
How long do I have to climb,
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night,
Planets are moving at the speed of light.
Climb up, up in the trees,
Every chance that you get,
Is a chance you seize.
How long am I gonna stand,
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop,
Before I see things the right way up.

All that noise, and all that sound,
All those places I have found.
And birds go flying at the speed of sound,
To show me how it all began.
Birds come flying from the underground,
If you could see it then you'd understand...

Ideas that you'll never find,
All the inventors could never design.
The buildings that you put up,
Japan and China all lit up.
The sign that I couldn't read,
Or a light that I couldn't see,
Some things you have to believe,
But others are puzzles, puzzling me.

All that noise, and all that sound,
All those places I got found.
And birds go flying at the speed of sound,
To show me how it all began.
Birds came flying from the underground,
If you could see it then you'd understand,
Ah when you see it then you'll understand...

All those signs, I knew what they meant.
Some things you can invent.
Some get made, and some get sent,
Ooh...
Birds go flying at the speed of sound,
To show me how it all began.
Birds came flying from the underground,
If you could see it then you'd understand,
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand...
They were sitting
They were sitting
In the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious

They were sitting
They were talking
In the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing

Cold, cold water
Bring me round
Now my feet
Won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water
What ya say?
It's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up
To strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing

People leaving all the time
Inside
A perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna curve away
It's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you
It's a waste of time

Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you
It's a waste of time

Could be blue
Could be grey
Without you
I'm just miles away

Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you
It's a waste of time
Well I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she used to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Well her heart was filled with gladness
When she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was
Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman
What she's longing for
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore

Then I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene
And every night when I'd come home
With every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Well I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights
More than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
There is a place, it has a face
And he was walking out the door
His mother said, she was ashamed
‘Cause he had no place to go
He was afraid and I was fine
He wanted peace of mind

Three times turn and you go and you go
You are free, you are free, it’s a long way home
And what have we done
Was it wrong, was it wrong, was it me
Can't you see it’s a long way home

There is a snake, he will awake
And he will get you off the floor
You'll start to shake, your friends will sweat
You are high you will forget
She is afraid ‘cause you are dying
But you have got your peace of mind

Three times turn and you go and you go
You are free, you are free, it’s a long way home
And what have we done
Was it wrong, was it wrong, was it me
Can't you see it’s a long way home

I won’t make your dreams come true
It’s on you, got to change your lonely ways
To make it through

You found a place in outer space
And you don't hurt anymore
Your loving hand has slipped away
And there is nothing left to say
And we were born of yellow sand
There is no plan, there is no end

Three times turn and you go and you go
You are free, you are free, it’s a long way home
And all night long I was wrong, I was wrong, it was me
Can't you see it’s a long way home

It took a million lives to see her smile
Don't touch it’s to much afraid of love
Afraid you might get hurt
Don't give up, don't get stuck
Right before you can go back
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up

See a pearl form a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, it's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
"Sitting with the poison takes away the pain"
Up and up, up and up

We’re gonna get it, get it together
Right now we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart

Yes I want to know, yes, I want to feel
Yes I want to grow, show me how to heal it up, heal it up

Try and see the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying

We’re gonna get it, get it together
Right now we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind, or take a risk
You can say "it's mine" and clench your fists
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We’re gonna get it, get it together
Right now we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

We’re gonna get it, get it together
Right now we’re gonna get it, get it together somehow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and flower

We’re gonna get it, get it together
I know, we’re gonna get it, get it together and flow
We’re gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you’re in pain, when you think you've had enough
Don’t ever give up

Don't ever give up
Believe in love
Was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow
White snow

Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below

When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fog
Became God

Priests clutched onto bibles
And went out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft

Bury me in honor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
A love back home unfolds

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
With the captain of some sinking ship
With snow, far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to violet hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still

So if you love me
Won't you let me know?

If you love me,
Won't you let me know?
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
[Verse 1: Chris Martin and Choir]
Holy, Holy
Dove descend
Soft and slowly
When I'm near the end

[Verse 2: Chris Martin and Choir]
Holy, Holy
Dark defend
Shield me, show me
When I need a friend

[Chorus: Chris Martin and Choir]
Slowly, slowly
Violence, end
Love reign o'er me
When I need a friend

[Outro: Sample from the film 'Everything Is Incredible']
Hombre, mire
Ah, propiamente
Para toda la gente ha sido motivo de burla
Por que todo el mundo piensa que es una cosa imposible
Que es cuestión de locos
El problema es que todo es increíble
Y la gente no lo acepta
